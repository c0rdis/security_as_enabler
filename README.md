# Cybersecurity as Enabler

If you work as a CISO, one of the key aspects of your job is to speak the business language and demonstrate how security contributes to the success of the company. 

Below is a humble attempt to go beyond *"if you don't do this, you'll get hacked, so give me money"* that will hopefully be helpful to fellow CISOs and anyone who has to sell the idea of cybersecurity.

Note that risk reduction remains the key argument in the executive conversations, and contextual Cyber Risk Quantification (CRQ) is probably the best way to provide business-relevant numbers on the state of your residual risk and justify the costs.
